Main Goal:
         Preventing the outcome of databrach by reducing the impact of mostly used attack vectors:
         *Social Engineering => Phising(cloning a website and getting user credentials)
         *sql injection => SQL injection is a code injection technique, used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution.
         
Techniques Implemented:
          End To End Encryption with esolang.
          Phishing deduction using page rank.
          
Extension risk:
              dedects phishing page with risk assesement using cookies.
              
Extension Risk2:
              Dedects phishing page using page rank method.
              
Deadfish Encryption:
              Enhances the security of database with additional sever side encryption.

# DEADFISH Dependencies:
  Hashlib
  pyfiglte
  (Python Libraries)
  
  - Chrome extensions: 
   Need to import the loaded pack of extension risk and extension page rank.
   
# What is deadfish?
            Deadfish is a very odd interpreted programming language created by Jonathan Todd Skinner. It was released under public domain and was originally programmed in C, but has since been ported to many other programming languages (see below).

Deadfish has a way to output things but it has no way to input them! It only has a few commands, only four in total. It is also case-sensitive, and can deal only with integer values when adding or subtracting, however once squared this number increases greatly! 

These are weird encoding that we like to implement in database as server side secondary hashing and then again encrypt with MD5 hash,which is a mysql function..

So by doing so we protect the integrity of the database eventhough it is breached,it cant be bruteforced like a normal hashes.

# Why Phishing Sites?
Social engineering is the term used for a broad range of malicious activities accomplished through human interactions. It uses psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information.

Social engineering attacks happen in one or more steps. A perpetrator first investigates the intended victim to gather necessary background information, such as potential points of entry and weak security protocols, needed to proceed with the attack. Then, the attacker moves to gain the victimâ€™s trust and provide stimuli for subsequent actions that break security practices, such as revealing sensitive information or granting access to critical resources.

So basically it happens due to the art of manipulating people.To descriminate a cloned website and legitmate website,We can do a  dns lookup to find the traffic of the certainwebsite and alert the users.

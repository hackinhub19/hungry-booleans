   What is deadfish?
            Deadfish is a very odd interpreted programming language created by Jonathan Todd Skinner. It was released under public domain and was originally programmed in C, but has since been ported to many other programming languages (see below).

Deadfish has a way to output things but it has no way to input them! It only has a few commands, only four in total. It is also case-sensitive, and can deal only with integer values when adding or subtracting, however once squared this number increases greatly! 

These are weird encoding that we like to implement in database as server side secondary hashing and then again encrypt with MD5 hash,which is a mysql function..

So by doing so we protect the integrity of the database eventhough it is breached,it cant be bruteforced like a normal hashes.
